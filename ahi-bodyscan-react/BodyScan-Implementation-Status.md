# Body Scan Implementation Status

## âœ… Completed Features

### 1. Core Architecture
- âœ… Routing updated to use `/scan/body` path
- âœ… BodyScanService with phase-based workflow
- âœ… ModelService for ML inference using TensorFlow.js
- âœ… Integration with existing CameraService

### 2. ML Models
- âœ… CoreML models copied to BodyScanML directory
- âœ… Model conversion script created (template)
- âœ… Using TensorFlow.js pre-trained models:
  - MoveNet for pose detection
  - BodyPix for segmentation
- âœ… Measurement calculation algorithm (simplified)

### 3. User Interface
- âœ… BodyScanSetup: User profile input with validation
- âœ… BodyScanCapture: Camera view with pose overlay
- âœ… BodyScanResults: Display measurements and images
- âœ… BodyScanScreen: Main orchestrator managing flow

### 4. Features Implemented
- âœ… Real-time pose detection with visual feedback
- âœ… Dual-phase capture (front + side views)
- âœ… Pose validation for correct positioning
- âœ… Results saved to localStorage
- âœ… Integration with existing profile system

## ðŸš§ Remaining Tasks

### High Priority
1. **Improve Measurement Accuracy**
   - Current implementation uses simplified calculations
   - Need to port actual SVR algorithms or use better models
   - Consider training custom TensorFlow.js models

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Implement Web Workers for ML inference
   - Add model caching and lazy loading
   - Optimize frame processing rate

3. **Error Handling**
   - Add comprehensive error messages
   - Implement retry mechanisms
   - Handle camera permission issues

### Medium Priority
1. **UI Polish**
   - Add skeleton connections between joints
   - Improve positioning guidance
   - Add progress indicators during processing
   - Style the components to match app theme

2. **Data Visualization**
   - Add charts for body composition
   - Show measurement history
   - Compare with previous scans

### Low Priority
1. **3D Avatar Generation**
   - Integrate Three.js for 3D visualization
   - Port avatar generation algorithms
   - Add interactive 3D model viewer

2. **Advanced Features**
   - Multiple profile support
   - Export functionality (PDF/CSV)
   - Social sharing options

## Usage Instructions

### To Test Body Scan:
1. Navigate to Home screen
2. Click "New Scan" button
3. Select "Body Scan"
4. Fill in profile information (height, weight, gender)
5. Follow on-screen instructions for front pose
6. Capture front image when pose is valid
7. Follow instructions for side pose
8. Capture side image
9. View results and save

### Known Issues:
- VastMindzSDK still has TypeScript errors (unrelated to body scan)
- Measurement accuracy needs improvement
- Camera preview might need styling adjustments
- Loading models may take a few seconds on first use

## Technical Notes

### Model Loading
Models are loaded on-demand when body scan is initialized. First load may take 5-10 seconds depending on network speed.

### Pose Detection
Using MoveNet SinglePose Lightning model for real-time performance. Processes frames at 10 FPS to balance accuracy and performance.

### Measurement Calculation
Current implementation uses pixel-to-real ratio based on user height. More sophisticated algorithms from the original SDK need to be ported.

### Data Storage
Results are saved to localStorage with the following keys:
- `bodyScanResults`: Array of all scan results
- `latestBodyScan`: Most recent scan result

## Next Development Steps
1. Improve measurement accuracy by porting SVR algorithms
2. Add comprehensive error handling
3. Optimize performance with Web Workers
4. Polish UI/UX based on user feedback
5. Implement 3D avatar visualization
